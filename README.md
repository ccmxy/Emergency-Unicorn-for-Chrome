#Emergency Unicorn

Upon clicking the extension icon, all images in the browser window are replaced
with this image of a unicorn:

![unicorn img] (./unicorn.png?raw=true "unicorn")

Simply refresh to turn the page back to its normal page.

It also replaces a few choice words in text on the page with different words.      

Drag cloned folder into Chrome extensions to use. A version of this extension that automatically replaces all images and words in the browser (without needing to click the extension) is on [the branch auto-unicorn](../../tree/auto-unicorn).
